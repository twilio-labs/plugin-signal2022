Like many organizations, Endeavor uses Twilio Segment to clean up its data, and make it usable across the company. However, because of the massive scale involved, it simply wasn’t possible to manage instance-by-instance. If each brand ran their own CDP, costs would skyrocket, not to mention that they would have just recreated the silos a CDP was supposed to eliminate. Enter APIs. In this session, you’ll learn how Endeavor leverages the Segment API to efficiently manage and govern their data, and scale marketing best practices across its many brands.</p>",

Through advanced call control software, developers can build customized applications that address use cases such as contact centers, call tracking and analytics solutions and anonymized communications. Our voice software works over both the traditional public switched<br />\ntelephone network (“PSTN”) and over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”). Programmable Voice includes:<br />\n• Twilio Voice: Initiate, receive and manage phone calls globally, end to end through traditional voice technology or between web browsers and landlines or mobile phones.<br />\n• Call Recording: Securely record, store, transcribe and retrieve voice calls in the cloud.<br />\n• Global Conference: Integrate audio conferencing that intelligently routes calls through cloud data centers in the closest geographic region to reduce latency.<br />\n• Voice Insights: Call quality and performance data at the fingertips of our customers. Beyond details of a single call, every account on Twilio has access to the Voice Insights Dashboard, a powerful tool in Twilio Console that provides out-of-the-box visibility to key performance indicators and data to understand changes in call behavior.<br />\n• Media Streams: Allows for real-time access to the raw audio stream of your phone calls. Through Media Streams our customers can fork the media of a phone call in real-time, effectively creating a copy of the initial audio stream that can be routed to your own application or to a third party to power advanced capabilities of your choosing.<br />\n• SHAKEN/STIR: Signature-based Handling of Asserted Information Using toKENs (“SHAKEN”) and Secure Telephone Identity Revisited (“STIR”) standards (together, “SHAKEN/STIR”) is a<br />\nprotocol mandated by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) to combat the rise in unwanted robocalls and unlawful caller ID spoofing.

    "description":"<p>Today, consumers are conditioned to expect highly-personalized experiences - thanks to the amazing customer service experiences in industries like retail, entertainment and so on. Healthcare should be no different. But it lags.. COVID-19 accelerated the adoption of digital health tools in HC. Providers now have the tech to deliver personalized, frictionless communications experiences. The patient experience will radically transform in the coming years.

Whether it’s building, buying or partnering, we're helping providers redefine the patient experience.</p>",
